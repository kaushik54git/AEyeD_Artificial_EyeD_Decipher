# AEyeD - Artificial Eye Decipher

Face and Gesture Recognition, Vehicles and Stairs Detection, and Text recognition for visually impaired people using the CNN and Keras-based algorithm

AEyeD is an electronic device integrated with a camera attached to spectacles, along with earphones. The device features three buttons: "Start Camera," "Rename Face," and "Text Recognition." It captures real-time images and identifies familiar faces, vocalizing the person's name to the user through the earphones. If an unidentified face is detected, it stores the image in a separate folder. Users have the option to rename the image through voice assistance, after which it is moved to the identified face folder.

Moreover, the device can recognize human gestures such as handshakes and high fives, verbally communicating them to the user. This capability fosters confidence in conversation and prevents the other person from feeling ignored.

Furthermore, AEyeD can detect parked vehicles and the presence of stairs, indicating their direction. Additionally, it can recognize text and read it aloud to the user.
