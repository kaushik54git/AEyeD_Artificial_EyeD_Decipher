# 👁️ AEyeD – Artificial Eye Decipher

**Face & Gesture Recognition | Vehicle & Stairs Detection | Text Reading for the Visually Impaired**
  
***

## 📝 Project Overview

**AEyeD** is a comprehensive smart-assistive device designed to empower visually impaired individuals. It integrates a camera-equipped spectacle frame with earphones, bringing advanced perception abilities like face, gesture, obstacle, and text recognition using **CNN and Keras-based algorithms**.

***

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition**
  - Identifies familiar faces and announces names through earphones.
  - Unrecognized faces are stored for later identification/renaming using simple voice commands.

- **Gesture Detection**
  - Recognizes social gestures (handshakes, high fives) and vocalizes to the user — promoting confident social interactions.

- **Vehicle & Stairs Detection**
  - Alerts about parked vehicles and nearby stairs, including directional guidance for safer navigation.

- **Text Recognition & Reading**
  - Reads printed/digital text aloud, making everyday information like signs and documents instantly accessible.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The device offers three user-friendly buttons:
- **Start Camera** – Initiates image capture and live analysis.
- **Rename Face** – Helps assign/modify names for new faces via voice interface.
- **Text Recognition** – Triggers instant reading of visible text.
